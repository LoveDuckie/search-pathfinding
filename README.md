# Python Tool Template

This repository is a template for creating Python tools with a consistent structure and standard features like linting, testing, and packaging.

## Features

- **Python Package Structure**: Includes a basic Python package setup (`search-pathfinding`).
- **Testing Setup**: Example test files (`search-pathfinding_tests`) for unit testing.
- **Development Tools**: Shell scripts to automate formatting, linting, testing (`run_format.sh`, `run_lint.sh`, `run_tests.sh`), and renaming (`rename.sh`).
- **Project Configuration**: Uses `pyproject.toml` for dependency management with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency and project management


### Dependencies

The project uses several dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml`. Below is a summary of the main dependencies and their purposes:

- **[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)**: Used for dependency management and packaging.
- **Linting and Formatting**: Includes tools like `pylint` and `black` to ensure code quality and consistency.
- **Testing**: Uses `pytest` for unit testing to ensure the functionality of the code.

To install the dependencies, use:

```sh
poetry install
```

### Project Dependencies

This project relies on the following dependencies to ensure functionality, development efficiency, and maintainability:

- **[rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich)**: For rendering rich text, tables, and progress bars in the terminal, enhancing the user experience of the CLI.
- **[rich-click](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click)**: Combines Rich and Click to add rich-text formatting and improve the usability of the command-line interface.
- **[click](https://github.com/pallets/click)**: A framework for building flexible and easy-to-use command-line interfaces (CLI).

### Development & Testing Dependencies

- **[black](https://github.com/psf/black)**: Automatically formats code to ensure consistent style across the project.
- **[pylint](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint)**: Provides static code analysis to enforce coding standards and detect potential bugs.
- **[coverage](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy)**: Measures the coverage of unit tests, helping to ensure all code paths are tested.

### Documentation Dependencies

- **[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/)**: Generates project documentation in formats such as HTML and PDF.
- **[sphinx-rtd-theme](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme)**: Provides a clean, responsive theme for documentation, styled like Read the Docs.

These dependencies help streamline development, testing, and documentation while ensuring a user-friendly command-line interface.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/search-pathfinding.git
    cd search-pathfinding
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```sh
    poetry install
    ```

### Running the Tool

To run the main script:

```sh
poetry run python -m search-pathfinding
```

### Development

#### Formatting

To format the codebase:

```sh
./run_format.sh
```

#### Linting

To lint the codebase:

```sh
./run_lint.sh
```

#### Testing

To run the tests:

```sh
./run_tests.sh
```

#### Renaming the Project

To rename the project (e.g., change the package name from `search-pathfinding` to something else):

```sh
./rename.sh new_project_name
```

### Project Structure

- `search-pathfinding/`: The main package containing the tool's source code.
- `search-pathfinding_tests/`: Contains unit tests for the package.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and folders to be ignored by Git.
- `pyproject.toml`: Project configuration and dependency management file.
- `LICENSE`: The license for this project.
